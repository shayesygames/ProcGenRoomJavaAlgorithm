This project is to test implementations of Procedural Room Generation Algorithms, specifically looking at using Binary Search trees to divide up a space on a coordinate grid into individual "rooms" and how those rooms can be connected together before creating an implementation in Unity or Unreal or Godot.

12/26/25
 - Initial work completed to create and divide rooms on a 2D grid, rooms are not very varied at this point, mostly conforming to a simple set of rules that can be modified later once the implementation is better understood
 - the project has a working algorithm for 2D room generation, connections algorithm has initial work done and appears to be mostly functioning correctly, though testing around this needs to be done
12/28/25
 - added testing around room connection generation, tests known happy path (good connection created) and known bad scenarios (rooms that cannot be connected)
 - added initial pass at visual representation in JFrame, room drawing is simple enough, but figuring out the coords for the connections/doors is proving somewhat difficult
 - room connection generation issue found, rooms only connect to themselves
   - fixed, faulty comparison issue
 - added some safety around double comparisons
 - noted connection issue for diagonal rooms, need to check/update
12/29/25
 - inverted Y axis on JPanel visual output so output is organized like a math coord plane
 1/1/26
 - finished the logic for drawing connections between rooms
 - implemented tests for creating connections between rooms, added several diagonal cases that should be failing the unit test, but are not currently, need to look into this further
1/2/26
 - updated diagonal connection determination, should not give more false positives
 - added some randomness to room size, done by allowing rooms to choose not to divide even if there is space to divide
 - added a traversal of completed rooms at the end of connection creation to make sure that all rooms are reachable from any room
 - cleanups


 Goals/Next steps
  - update division method to allow that a room with length > minimum size and height = minimum size are able to be divided, but only by length
