This project is to test implementations of Procedural Room Generation Algorithms, specifically looking at using Binary Search trees to divide up a space on a coordinate grid into individual "rooms" and how those rooms can be connected together before creating an implementation in Unity or Unreal or Godot.

Summary of work
 - Initial work completed to create and divide rooms on a 2D grid, rooms are not very varied at this point, mostly conforming to a simple set of rules that can be modified later once the implementation is better understood
 - as of 12/26/2025, the project has a working algorithm for 2D room generation, connections algorithm has initial work done and appears to be mostly functioning correctly, though testing around this needs to be done
 -

 Goals/Next steps
  - implement testing of known bad connection scenarios
  - add simple rendering component to replace text printout of results
  - implement rooms that can have randomized sizes, aka rooms that will not always have one wall of the minimum length
  - update division method to allow that a room with length > minimum size and height = minimum size are able to be divided, but only by length
